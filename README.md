# Replacement #
This assignment asks you to imagine that you need to send an email to a lot of different people.
For the most part, that email is the same for all the people, excpet for their name and a few other details that are specific to each person.
* Write a fictional email that may need to be sent to more than 10 people.
* Create at least 5 varriables that would be specific to each person getting the email.
  * At least one varrialbe should be a string
  * At least one varriable should be a double
  * At least one varriable should be an int
  * At least one varriable should be a boolean
* Create static final constant varriables for each of these for some specific person you invent.
* Make sure the code compiles, runs, and shows a visually satisfying email in the command console.
* Make the email as silly as you like, but it should be recognizable as a form (AKA:SPAM) email.

# Processing #
Using the varriables you created preform at least one of the following operations:
* Addition
* Conditional check with a boolean
* Conditional check with a string
* String concatination with a string
* String concatination with a number

# LoopIt!
Use a FOR LOOP to quickly generate 10 identical copies of this email

# Loop and Process
Use the index counter in your FOR LOOP to do additional processing:
* Exclude certain sentences from your email, depending on whether it is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th (etc) in the loop.
* Do a math operation using one of the varriable numbers and you index counter
* Use the RANDOM object (requires an IMPORT statement) to change a string varriable in randomly selected emails generated by your loop.
